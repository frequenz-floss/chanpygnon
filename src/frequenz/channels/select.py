    If `Select` was created with more `AsyncIterator` than what are read in

    a warning message is logged.

    [Receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver]s also function as `AsyncIterator`.

    Example:
        For example, if there are two async iterators that you want to

        ```python
        select = Select(name1 = receiver1, name2 = receiver2)
