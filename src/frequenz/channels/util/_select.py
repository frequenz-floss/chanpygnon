    """Select the next available message from a group of Receivers.

    If `Select` was created with more `Receiver` than what are read in
    the if-chain after each call to
    [ready()][frequenz.channels.util.Select.ready], messages coming in the
    additional receivers are dropped, and a warning message is logged.

    [Receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver]s also function as `Receiver`.

    When Select is no longer needed, then it should be stopped using
    `self.stop()` method. This would cleanup any internal pending async tasks.

    Example:
        For example, if there are two receivers that you want to
        simultaneously wait on, this can be done with:

        ```python
        select = Select(name1 = receiver1, name2 = receiver2)
        while await select.ready():
            if msg := select.name1:
                if val := msg.inner:
                    # do something with `val`
                    pass
                else:
                    # handle closure of receiver.
                    pass
            elif msg := select.name2:
