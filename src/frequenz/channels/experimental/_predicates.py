    """A predicate to check if a message has a particular relationship with the previous one.

    This predicate can be used to filter out messages based on a custom condition on the
    previous and current messages. This can be useful in cases where you want to
    process messages only if they satisfy a particular condition with respect to the
    previous message.

    Tip:
        If you want to use `==` as predicate, you can use the
        [`ChangedOnly`][frequenz.channels.experimental.ChangedOnly] predicate.

    Example: Receiving only messages that are not the same instance as the previous one.
        ```python
        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast
        from frequenz.channels.experimental import OnlyIfPrevious

        channel = Broadcast[int | bool](name="example")
        receiver = channel.new_receiver().filter(OnlyIfPrevious(lambda old, new: old is not new))
        sender = channel.new_sender()

        # This message will be received as it is the first message.
        await sender.send(1)
        assert await receiver.receive() == 1

        # This message will be skipped as it is the same instance as the previous one.
        await sender.send(1)

        # This message will be received as it is a different instance from the previous
        # one.
        await sender.send(True)
        assert await receiver.receive() is True
        ```

    Example: Receiving only messages if they are bigger than the previous one.
        ```python
        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast
        from frequenz.channels.experimental import OnlyIfPrevious

        channel = Broadcast[int](name="example")
        receiver = channel.new_receiver().filter(
            OnlyIfPrevious(lambda old, new: new > old, first_is_true=False)
        )
        sender = channel.new_sender()

        # This message will skipped as first_is_true is False.
        await sender.send(1)

        # This message will be received as it is bigger than the previous one (1).
        await sender.send(2)
        assert await receiver.receive() == 2

        # This message will be skipped as it is smaller than the previous one (1).
        await sender.send(0)

        # This message will be skipped as it is not bigger than the previous one (0).
        await sender.send(0)

        # This message will be received as it is bigger than the previous one (0).
        await sender.send(1)
        assert await receiver.receive() == 1

    This predicate can be used to filter out messages that are the same as the previous

    Warning:
        This predicate uses the `!=` operator to compare messages, which includes all
        the weirdnesses of Python's equality comparison (e.g., `1 == 1.0`, `True == 1`,
        `True == 1.0`, `False == 0` are all `True`).

        If you need to use a different comparison, you can create a custom predicate
