"""Frequenz Channels.

This package contains
[channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(programming)) implementations.

Main base classes and functions:

* [Sender][frequenz.channels.Sender]: An object that can send messages to
  a channel.

* [Receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver]: An object that can wait for and
  consume messages from a channel.

* [selected()][frequenz.channels.select]: A function to wait on multiple
  receivers at once.

Channels:

* [Anycast][frequenz.channels.anycast.Anycast]: A channel that supports multiple
  senders and multiple receivers.  A message sent through a sender will be
  received by exactly one receiver.

* [Bidirectional][frequenz.channels.bidirectional.Bidirectional]: A channel providing
  a `client` and a `service` handle to send and receive bidirectionally.

* [Broadcast][frequenz.channels.broadcast.Broadcast]: A channel to broadcast messages
  from multiple senders to multiple receivers. Each message sent through any of
  the senders is received by all of the receivers.
